# Vision
Gitor is a community project. From our current viewpoint, its role is:
The project implements a simple mirroring implementation in pure Go.

Our detailed items:
  * No reliance on non Go code/deps
* Simple mirroring for now
* Edgecases might not be added

## Core ConceptGitor wants to make a static binary git mirroring cli tool possible.


## Communication
A lot of discussion about Gitor happens within Github issues. Ideally, we will keep it that way until Gitor becomes big enough that this turns into a problem. The advantages of this is that all documentation and issues are publicly searchable and easily linked to the source code.

## Contributions
The Gitor project should always aim to devote a lot of time to making contributors feel like an important part of the community. We should strive to provide a place for anyone to be able to contribute. The aim of the core team should be to work on ways to showcase contributions, encourage adoption and show off great work. An example of where this worked is the [CocoaPods Quality Index](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods.org-Two-point-Five/).
